EDA: Use seaborn on the dataframe to create a pairplot with the hue indicated by the TARGET CLASS column. 

Standardize the Variables: Because the KNN classifier predicts the class of a given test observation by identifying the observations that are nearest to it, the scale of the variables matters. Any variables that are on a large scale will have a much larger effect on the distance between the observations, and hence on the KNN classifier, than variables that are on a small scale.
